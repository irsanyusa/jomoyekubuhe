Her Stage Name Came to Her in a Dream</h3><p>Born Jane Marczewski, the Ohio native revealed that her stage name came to her in a dream. Multiple nights in a row, she dreamt that birds were singing outside her bedroom window in the dark.&nbsp;While the first two times were dreams, the third instance actually happened.&nbsp;She wanted to be somebody that could sing through a dark time, because she was so full of hope that there would be a new morning: Nightbirde was born.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-she-was-previously-married>2. She Was Previously Married</h3><p>In 2019, doctors expected Nightbirde to live only three to six months. After this diagnosis, her husband of five years, musician Jeremy Claudio, ended their marriage. After that blow, she moved to California in search of a cure and for&nbsp;a short time, she was cancer free, but ultimately, her illness returned.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-nightbirde-triumphed-through-a-mental-health-crisis>3. Nightbirde Triumphed Through a Mental Health Crisis</h3><p>The stress from her failing physical health and recent divorce caused her to suffer a “catatonic mental breakdown.” On her GoFundMe page, she reveals that she barely spoke, ate, or moved from bed for several months.&nbsp;The help from specialists discovered that the events of this year had caused a physical head trauma. Luckily, Brain Wave Therapy made huge strides in her recovery as she continued to sing again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-she-has-her-own-blog>4. She Has Her Own Blog</h3><p>As you can tell from her song lyrics, Nightbirde is a beautiful writer. She has documented her life in several blog posts, where she speaks poetically about her life. Linked to her Instagram, you are taken to the post <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“God is on the Bathroom Floor.”</a> It’s a gorgeous piece, and in it, she speaks about how on her sickest days, she would seek comfort on the cool bathroom floor and pray. Which brings us to our next discovery.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-nightbirde-is-very-connected-to-her-faith>5. Nightbirde is Very Connected to Her Faith</h3><p>Nightbirde attended Liberty University, which is a Christian school, and also has a significant tattoo in reference to the bible.&nbsp;On her right forearm, she has seven dots. In a <a href=# class=broken_link>news interview </a>she said: “there’s&nbsp; a verse in the Bible that says a righteous person falls seven times and gets back up again.”&nbsp;If there is anyone out there who lives by that, it’s Nightbirde.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-she-recorded-a-live-version-of-it-s-ok>6. She Recorded a Live Version of “It’s OK”</h3><p>Nightbirde took to Nashville to record her AGT audition song for Maple House sessions on YouTube.

Her other popular songs include “Girl in a Bubble” and “New Years Eve.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-nightbirde-has-merch>8. Nightbirde Has Merch</h3><p>The Nightbirde store has a variety of apparel for purchase. On the site, you can buy hoodies with “It’s OK” written on the front. You can also buy t-shirts with the famous phrase that made <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> himself tear up. “You can’t wait until life’s not hard before you decide to be happy.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-she-is-all-about-spreading-positivity>9. She is All About Spreading Positivity</h3><p>With all of the things that Nightbirde’s been through, it would be easy for her to have a&nbsp;negative attitude and focus on the downsides of life. However, she refuses to do that.&nbsp;Instead, she chooses to focus on the good things she has going for herself, and she hopes to spread this positivity to others.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-she-has-a-large-social-media-presence>10.
