That’s because consumers with a high level of trust in a brand are more likely to buy its products, regardless of price. They’re also more likely to explore other products from the same brand.</span></p><p><span>For example, let’s take a look at Ritual, a company that offers online subscription services for multivitamins and other health products. Since its launch, Ritual has stuck by its promise to provide quality products and transparency with regard to ingredients, earning the company glowing reviews along the way. These efforts helped Ritual build high levels of trust and loyalty among its customer base, which in turn allowed it to grow its product offerings from just a basic multivitamin to a comprehensive supplement line, including prenatal vitamins, gut health support and essential protein powders.</span></p><h3 id=consumer-values><strong><b>Consumers buy from brands that align with their values</b></strong></h3><p><span>A company’s values play a huge role in </span><span>building brand trust</span><span>. These days, there’s a large focus on a company’s corporate social responsibility, which typically includes:</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><span>Reducing carbon footprints</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Diversity, equity and inclusion</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Charitable efforts globally</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Environmentally conscious investments</span></li></ul><p><span>As the reality of climate change becomes more pronounced in our everyday lives and consumers continue to hold organizations accountable, sustainability will be a major factor in establishing brand trust in 2023 and the years to come. </span><a href=#><span>Morning Consult’s Sustainability Report</span></a><span> unpacks consumers’ attitudes, behaviors and expectations around sustainability, as well as how it influences brand trust. </span><a href=#><span>Download the full report</span></a><span> to explore what this looks like across different industries.</span></p><p><span>With corporate social responsibility initiatives on the rise, the pressure continues to fall on CEOs to speak out on issues of political, social and cultural importance.

Personalized, high-quality experiences show customers that their needs are understood, which translates to increased brand loyalty over time.</span></p><h3 id=target-audience><strong><b>Build a deep understanding of your target audience and market</b></strong></h3><p><span>The more you understand your audience, the more effectively you can target them. And the more intentional you are with your marketing, the more your audience feels understood and connected, increasing the likelihood that they will trust and purchase from your brand.</span></p><p><span>Soliciting current customer feedback often isn’t enough. </span><a href=#><span>Morning Consult’s custom research solutions</span></a><span> aid in monitoring consumer behaviors and brand perception among target audiences, so you can continuously improve customer experience, adjust marketing strategies and differentiate your brand from competitors.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/10/31105742/brands-newsletter-desktop-wide-v2.png alt="Brand insights newsletter subscription" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3 id=customer-journey><strong><b>Thoughtfully guide prospective customers to the solution best suited to their needs</b></strong></h3><p><span>Going hand in hand with providing a great customer experience and understanding your target audience is being able to guide prospective customers to the solution best suited to their needs. Brands should never take a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather build a </span><a href=#><span>deep understanding of their audience’s unique needs</span></a><span> and tailor marketing and communications accordingly. The more prospective customers feel their needs are understood, the more likely they are to purchase and maintain loyalty to your brand.</span></p><h3 id=brand-values><strong><b>Establish your brand values and stand by them</b></strong></h3><p><span>These days, it’s not enough to just state your company’s mission. Consumers expect brands to reflect their own values.</span></p><p><span>Remaining authentic to your spoken values and culture goes a long way with consumers. This means being present on </span><span>social media platforms</span><span> by interacting with your audience and showcasing your CSR efforts. The more authentic you are, the more trust you build.</span></p><h3 id=customer-relationships><strong><b>Prioritize and maintain customer relationships</b></strong></h3><p><span>When customers feel that a brand understands their needs and cares about their satisfaction, they are more likely to trust the brand and continue purchasing from it. Maintaining strong customer relationships stems from providing a high-quality experience — the ultimate goal of a successful brand.</span></p><h3 id=transparency><strong><b>Remain honest and transparent in brand communications</b></strong></h3><p><span>Transparent communication allows your audience to look under the hood of your brand, as well as its products and services, so you can maintain an honest and credible reputation. You can showcase this in several ways, such as maintaining public social media accounts where people can engage, interact and provide public feedback. Food & beverage brands, for example, often achieve transparency by publishing the ingredients of their products.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/11/30105737/Morning-Consult-Brand-Intelligence-Ad-Desktop-Wide.png alt="Morning Consult Brand Intelligence" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2 id=brand-strategy><strong><b>Inform your entire brand strategy with Morning Consult Brand Intelligence</b></strong></h2><p><a href=#><span>Morning Consult Brand Intelligence</span></a><span> enables communications, marketing and insights professionals to take their brand strategy to the next level.</span></p><p><span>We survey tens of thousands of people across the globe every day to provide real-time data on what consumers think about thousands of brands and products, giving business leaders the competitive advantage they need to make more informed decisions and achieve brand growth.
