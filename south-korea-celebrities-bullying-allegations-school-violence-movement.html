Despite initially denying bullying allegations, which included <a href=#>hitting classmates</a>, Song’s agency <a href=#>confirmed</a> Tuesday that she had been expelled from her high school because of “school violence.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bullying accusations in recent years have ensnared over a dozen public figures in South Korea—from entertainers to politicians to athletes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, An Woo-jin, one of the country’s top baseball pitchers, was <a href=#>excluded</a> from representing South Korea in an international tournament after claims emerged that he had assaulted his high school teammates. He was also de facto <a href=#>banned</a> from the Olympics and the Asian Games amid a suspension by the Korea Baseball Softball Association.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2021, sisters and famed volleyball players Lee Jae-yeong and Lee Da-yeong were <a href=#>dropped</a> from the national team and their club due to school bullying allegations; months later, they took their careers to a volleyball club in <a href=#>Greece</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And popular actor Ji Soo was practically purged from the entertainment industry in 2021 as <a href=#>accusations emerged</a> online that alleged he engaged in bullying in middle school and high school—including physically assaulting, and even sexually harassing, his schoolmates. Ji Soo <a href=#>apologized</a> in response to the bullying allegations, though he <a href=#>took legal action</a> against those spreading sexual harassment allegations, which he denies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even public figures who have not been accused of engaging directly in bullying have been sanctioned. Last year, senior prosecutor Jung Soon-shin’s appointment as chief of the National Office of Investigation was <a href=#>canceled</a> by President Yoon Suk-yeol after reports emerged that Jung had defended his son when the latter was accused of verbally harassing a high school classmate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bullying, or school violence (Hakpok in Korean), which Yoon has <a href=#>vowed</a> to combat, has taken center stage in public discourse in South Korea, where reports of such acts have <a href=#>surged</a> over the last decade. A <a href=#>survey</a> of college students in 2023 showed that 54% of respondents who had experienced school violence had considered suicide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While authorities have <a href=#>toughened penalties</a> for current school bullies and <a href=#>strengthened support for victims</a>, questions over how and whether adults can be legally held accountable for their teenage misdeeds have led to <a href=#>little recourse</a> for victims of past school violence but to go public.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A <a href=#>nationwide “Hakpok #MeToo” movement</a> of naming and shaming former school bullies was further fueled by a popular 2022 Netflix K-drama revenge series, The Glory, which contained scenes <a href=#>inspired by real school bullying cases</a>. (After an anonymous post accusing him of being a bully sparked widespread public anger, The Glory’s director, Ahn Gil-ho, <a href=#>admitted</a> to physically assaulting other students while he was in high school; actor Kim Hieora was also <a href=#>plagued</a> with similar allegations, which she denied, though she admitted that she was a bystander to bullying in middle school.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The public generally holds an unforgiving attitude toward alleged bullies: according to a 2023 <a href=#>survey</a> of South Koreans, 58% said that accused celebrities should put off public appearances until the allegation is verified, while 24% said that the accused celebrities should “cease all appearances immediately.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Psychology experts have attributed bullying to South Korea’s collectivist culture, peer pressure, and the country’s <a href=#>notoriously cut-throat education system</a>. But the intense backlash against alleged former bullies—whether verified or not—has also sparked concern, with some social workers warning that the demands for retribution can resemble a form of bullying and likening the intense public scrutiny to a <a href=#>“witch hunt.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The idea of damaging the career of a bully is not seen as problematic,” Jihoon Kim, a criminologist at the University of Alabama, told the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, “as they are seen as deserving it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZogHKEjqymrqyYYriwvsSaZJydnJqvs7XTopysZZKqua3FyKeeZpmcobKordOipqerXaiwqbvOpWSvoZ%2Bhsq%2BvxGakqK6VorKvwI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-woman-shares-a-video-of-her-crying-yellow-heres-why-it-happens-818345.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Woman Shares a Video of Her Crying Yellow: Heres Why It Happens">&larr;
