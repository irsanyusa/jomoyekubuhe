During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with <i>The Independent</i></a>, Alex mentioned his modelling career was a surprise. He stated:</p>I guess it would be getting scouted by storm and my whole modelling career kicking off. I never thought I'd have the potential to do anything like that or thought about myself in that way. So it is pretty surprising.<p class=align-left>At 16, he worked at pubs and restaurants and in the alcohol <a href=#>industry</a> for Diageo.

I think we were both looking for a new challenge and thought we'd make a great team, and here we are.<p class=align-left>Emma also disclosed how Alex encouraged her to pursue her career as a director. She revealed this while speaking to the <i><a id=https://www.ft.com/content/045a2d24-f207-4cc3-9a55-5d61a9633bf0 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Financial Times</a></i>. She stated:</p>People always told me I should direct and produce, even when I was on Potter. I was worried it was just technical, not creative, and I couldn't bring what I think is probably my skill set. It was only Alex coming to me with this, and friends asking for favours – 'I need to do a photo shoot' or 'I'm making a video' – that made me realise I actually know quite a lot about that.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4243c2cb2f8fc4fe.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Monica Barbaro's husband: Is the 'Top Gun' actress married?
