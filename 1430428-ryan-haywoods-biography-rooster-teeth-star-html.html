He left Rooster Teeth on October 6, 2020, after numerous sexual misconduct allegations. The following day, on October 7, the firm issued a statement claiming that they had parted ways with him as he had breached the firm's Code of Conduct.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b4ba3405e13248b3.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MightyDuck’s biography: age, sisters, mom, wife, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What did Ryan Haywood do to warrant firing? Around the time of Ryan's departure, an unnamed lady had come out alleging that she had had a sexual affair with the voice actor ever since she was seventeen years old. A Reddit user then escalated the issue by compiling a spreadsheet detailing other allegations levelled against Ryan.</p><p class=align-left>The allegations were mostly between 2016 and 2019, with a few dating back to 2004. One of the victims described Ryan as a manipulative predator who often took advantage of power dynamics to solicit sexual favours from underage girls.</p><p class=align-left>Following the allegations, Ryan from Rooster Teeth admitted that he made mistakes but divulged from providing further details on the matter. In a tweet on October 6, 2020, he stated that he had taken full responsibility for his actions. According to his statement, his family was experiencing a hard time with all the humiliations and threats.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/839224ceb2328ca7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dom Brack’s biography: age, height, birthday, who is he dating?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here is an excerpt of his statement.</p>I made mistakes and will be leaving RT to focus on rebuilding my family and life. I'm sorry to anyone I've hurt. I do want to say emphatically that I never did anything illegal. The consequences of my actions are mine to deal with; please stop harassing and threatening my family.<p class=align-left>Following these revelations, numerous Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter staff took steps to disassociate themselves from Ryan's tainted image. The situation worsened after the release of the <i>Red vs Blue</i> project was delayed to re-record Haywood's dialogue in the series.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Achievement Hunter co-founders, Michael Jones and Jack Pattillo vowed to clear every trace of the <a href=#>YouTube personality</a>, although they confessed that it would not be easy.</p><h3>Ryan's ouster from Twitch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1a3b7e89c0c73c76.jpg><p class=align-left>Following the sexual affair allegations, Twitch permanently banned Ryan Haywood from its platform after a massive push from the community urging the <a href=#>social media</a> company to take action.

Still, Ryan has largely kept his family away from the spotlight since his controversial exit from Rooster Teeth.</p><h3>Is Geoff still at Rooster Teeth?</h3><p class=align-left>Geoff Ramsey was among the six co-founders of the Rooster Teeth digital media company. In early 2012, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he moved away</a> from the company, citing numerous reasons that made it difficult for him to work. Since then, he has only appeared in a few non-Achievement Hunter-related Rooster Teeth productions.</p><h3>Where is Ryan Haywood now?</h3><p class=align-left>What happened at Achievement Hunter? On October 6, 2020, Ryan Haywood announced his departure from the company following a leak of explicit photographs and amid accusations of having sexual affairs with fans, including some minors. He has since disappeared from the public radar.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1445b010fc440ffd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trevor Wagner’s biography: age, height, brother, net worth</span></p></a><h3>Will Ryan Haywood ever return?</h3><p class=align-left>Possibly not. In a live stream held after a brief hiatus from the fallout, some of the Rooster Teeth founders, Pattillo and Michael Jones, deplored Haywood, announcing that several videos featuring him would be removed from Rooster Teeth's library and that he would never be allowed back at the company.</p><h3>What is Ryan Haywood's new job?</h3><p class=align-left>Where is Ryan Haywood in 2022? Not much is known about the former Rooster Teeth employee besides the fact that he now lives with his family in Austin, Texas.</p><h3>What is Ryan Haywood doing now?</h3><p class=align-left>There has not been any Ryan Haywood update in 2022 regarding a new job.</p><h2>Fun facts</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some interesting facts about Haywood.</p><ul><li>He voiced three different characters in the 2012-2017 Red vs Blue series</li><li>He is an excellent cameraman</li></ul><p class=align-left>Ryan Haywood left a mark in the gaming industry during his stint at Rooster Teeth.
