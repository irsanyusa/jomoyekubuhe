The edible seeds have a notably bitter taste, while there is also a slight sweetness to them. When consumed, bitter kola offers many nutrients, and studies have shown that the plant is high in carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamin c, calcium, potassium, iron and caffeine.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Health benefits of bitter kola nut:</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>1.The aphrodisiac credentials</h3></p><p>Traditional medicine considers bitter kola to be an <a href=# id=502919ec-dbd5-459f-ac42-72840ace8b55>aphrodisiac</a>, so it’s believed to increase sexual desire, pleasure and performance. With these qualities in mind, why not try some bitter kola to help turbo-charge your sex life!</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>2.The nuts may be a remedy for osteoarthritis</h3></p><p>With symptoms ranging from uncomfortable to debilitating, osteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis. It’s characterised by the degeneration of joint cartilage and the underlying bone, causing pain and stiffness, especially in the hip, knee, and thumb joints. The <a href=# id=5f06d06d-c172-4f49-9fcd-42b5708f6b2d>causes of osteoarthritis</a> can include joint injury, obesity, aging as well as hereditary factors.</p><p>Researchers at <a href=# id=2dd51d87-30c2-4c63-9b8c-353236d55698>Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria</a> tested bitter kola on the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and concluded that bitter kola may significantly reduce the inflammation and pain associated with the condition. The plant also increased joint movement in patients.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3. Bitter kola has antibacterial qualities</h3></p><p>A study published in the <a href=# id=7e81e5de-5a9b-4f4f-b239-ceb67541d623>Science Journal of Microbiology</a> has shown that both the bitter kola seeds and leafs have antibacterial properties. Bitter kola was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus Pyogenes, Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli, and the plant was able to inhibit these microorganisms. The antibacterial activity was found to be due to the presence of bioactive components in the extract such as tannin, and saponins.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>4.The nuts may improve the function of the lungs</h3></p><p>Results from research conducted <a href=# id=20b59cb8-507f-47ff-879e-3f85ef95b876>in conjunction with several Nigerian universities</a> showed that bitter kola has a positive effect on the lungs and can improve ventilation levels. Extracts of the plant have also been studied in relation to asthma, and there is the suggestion that bitter kola may have some protective effects against the respiratory disorder.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>5.Bitter kola nut may improve the immune system</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Bitter kola has a high concentration of antioxidants, which is a term for any compound that counteracts free radicals. While environmental stressors such as tobacco smoke, ultraviolet rays and air pollution cause free radical production, they are also produced by many normal processes in the body including exercise and our immune response. Free radicals damage DNA, cell membranes, and other parts of cells. So, as well as being essential assistance for important functions in the body, antioxidants also support the immune system. With a strong immune system we are better able to fight disease and stay healthy.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-130f563a-b42a-481b-a34c-8fafbef0af5c data-caption=bitter-kola-plant><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3zKktkpTURBXy9iMWE3ZWFmYzE1YjY5NGIwZDNkMWVkZGJkZjY0MmYzNS5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAbjCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>6.It may be an antimalarial agent</h3></p><p>Bitter kola contains the antioxidant kolaviron, which according to research published in the <a href=# id=68f41454-1dda-441c-b4b8-75cbafdc4c25>Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine</a>, shows positive results for antimalarial properties. Traditional healers have for many years prescribed bitter kola for the treatment of malaria infections, and now, scientific studies are starting to support their beliefs.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>7.Bitter kola may help to fight glaucoma</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Glaucoma is a condition of increased pressure within the eyeball, causing a gradual loss of sight, and can result in permanent blindness if left untreated.
