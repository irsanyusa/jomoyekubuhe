What makes him famous is his 19 years of dedication in his basketball career. He played for six teams and became one of the greatest players in NBA history. Beyond basketball, Shaq has also released four rap albums and several TV shows and films. With such dedication and performance, you can be sure that Shaquille Oneal net worth is impressive. How old is Shaq? Too young to become one of the wealthiest basketball stars in the world.</strong></p><p class=align-left>How old is Shaquille O'Neal? Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal was born on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 6th, 1972</a> in New Jersey. He is 47 years old. His father had long suffered from a drug addiction problem which saw him imprisoned for drug possession when O’Neal was still young. Hence the two never enjoyed the father-son relationship, and his father gave up his parental rights to the stepfather. His stepfather largely contributed to Shaquille Oneal net worth and his career success.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e0cc4856f6d89c04.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 highest paid college athletes and their earnings</span></p></a><h2>Shaquille O'Neal profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name</strong>: Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal</li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: Mar 6, 1972</li><li><strong>Birthplace</strong>: Newark, New Jersey, United States</li><li><strong>Shaquille O'Neal age</strong>: 47 years old</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: Barry University (Ed.D), University of Phoenix (MBA)</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Basketball player, actor, rapper, film producer, television producer, real estate entrepreneur</li><li><strong>Marital status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Children</strong>: 6</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: African-American</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: United States of America</li><li><strong>Shaquille O'Neal height</strong>: 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m)</li><li><strong>Shaquille O'Neal weight</strong>: 324 lbs (147 kg)</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Emma Stone net worth, house, tattoo, parents, brother, relationship</p><p class=align-left>Though Shaq had such a sad story with the father, he quickly became a star when he decided to venture into basketball.

However, what you may not know is that this retired-basketball star owns 155 locations. He holds more than 10% of this company’s franchises.</p><h4>Auntie Anne’s</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f92d99f4ff0d446a.jpg><p class=align-left>This is another food franchise that Shaquille has put some <a href=#>money</a> on, quite heavily. He owns 17 of the stands across the US, which earns him some good returns.</p><h3>Shaq endorsement deals</h3><p class=align-left>In addition to being a successful restaurant franchisee, a significant portion of his net worth, more than $20 million that Shaq makes each year from endorsement deals comes from food and beverages. Muscle Milk, Vitamin Water, Fruity Pebbles, and AriZona Cream Soda are just a few of the food companies and brands that have helped him rake in good money. AriZona launched Shaq Soda in June, and it was the most successful beverage launch in the company's history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c8a02555c6ce4ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 popular Nollywood stars who are over 40 and not married</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Rihanna net worth, age, full name, life before fame</p><h3>Shaq/Dunkman shoes</h3><p class=align-left>His Shaq/Dunkman lines of shoes are low-priced and hence have sold 100 million pairs globally. You will be amazed by his endorsement rules; he endorses products he uses. Due to this strict discipline, he has turned down several high profile deals including that of Starbucks and Wheaties as he simply does not use their products. He says he wants his dealings to be authentic.</p><h3>Real estate business</h3><p class=align-left>Another investment area that has raised Shaquille’s income is real estate. He adds to the many athletes who have invested in this field earning tens of millions from the venture. His stake is both on the commercial and residential properties. In 2006, he created the O’Neal Group, which as of now has an impressive portfolio.</p><p class=align-left>His first venture was The Met Miami, a residential property which sold more than 1,000 units.

He is a good athlete, and you cannot help but respect his dedication and efforts that have produced wins. Having grown in the world of athletics, it is no surprise that O’ Neal has invested in gyms. To be exact, he has 40 fitness franchises that operate 24/7.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, if you thought of them as just another gym, you are wrong. Shaq particularly puts his personal touch on all the details giving a true reflection of his commitment to fitness and to offer mentorship to an active lifestyle. He makes quite a good sum from his gyms annually.</p><h3>Tech investment</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/935548b1d6e525c6.jpg><p class=align-left>Shaquille O’Neal is also a wise man.
