This is&nbsp;your final attempt at&nbsp;escaping your chores for a&nbsp;month. If&nbsp;your sister wins, you’ll be&nbsp;the one doing them for both of&nbsp;you. Seconds away from that decisive throw, you slow down to&nbsp;think it&nbsp;over.</p><p>Rock, paper, scissors’ origins date back to&nbsp;the times of&nbsp;the Chinese Han dynasty [206&nbsp;BCE&nbsp;— 220&nbsp;AD]. It&nbsp;became more as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know it&nbsp;today in&nbsp;17th century Japan and had spread worldwide by&nbsp;the early 20th century. Some say it’s a&nbsp;silly random game of&nbsp;chance for two. Others call it&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategic system with a&nbsp;strong <a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> foundation.</p><p>They compete in&nbsp;championships and tournaments for those who take it&nbsp;seriously. If&nbsp;you wanna win one of&nbsp;those, you need to&nbsp;know a&nbsp;thing or&nbsp;two to&nbsp;build your success strategy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/33e/e2d/2eacc85589b5f5439008dfab42.png><p>There is&nbsp;some probability and basic psychology behind the game. Humans are somewhat predictable, so&nbsp;you can often guess the outcome of&nbsp;the toss and the game before it’s even played. There are four possible scenarios: a&nbsp;tie, rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good at&nbsp;rock paper scissors, the first rule is&nbsp;to&nbsp;never ever give yourself away and read your opponent like a&nbsp;book. Newbies often clench their fists before throwing a&nbsp;rock or&nbsp;slightly stick out an&nbsp;index finger before playing scissors. And the most telling thing is&nbsp;throwing a&nbsp;move too early.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# title=research data-link=tag>research</a>, most people prefer to&nbsp;begin the game by&nbsp;playing rock. Well, it&nbsp;comes first in&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the game itself, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes sense, doesn’t it? Or, they might go&nbsp;rock because it&nbsp;gives the comforting feel of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sturdy fist. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you wanna stand out and increase your chances of&nbsp;winning, don’t be&nbsp;like the majority and go&nbsp;paper first.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re playing against a&nbsp;guy, again, paper is&nbsp;your best first choice. Another research shows that men mostly go&nbsp;with the rock on&nbsp;the first throw. So&nbsp;you can surprise him with paper and mess up&nbsp;his strategy. Ha&nbsp;ha. Scissors is&nbsp;statistically the least popular move, and rock is&nbsp;the most thrown one. That’s why going paper is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;safe option. Scissors can beat&nbsp;it, but it’s way less popular than rock, and paper can wrap it&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f1d/aa9/c25c835c018326922f4473f379.png><p>If&nbsp;you lost a&nbsp;game as&nbsp;you played rock and your opponent went paper, they’re likely to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;their strategy and play paper again. But you can think one step ahead and play scissors. This works for all the times you lose a&nbsp;throw. Go&nbsp;with the move that didn’t previously come&nbsp;up, and you have a&nbsp;chance of&nbsp;turning the tables. If&nbsp;you won the previous game when you played rock and your opponent played scissors, your rival will most likely change their strategy and play paper.</p><p>But you’re thinking one step ahead, remember? Play what they just played as&nbsp;they won’t expect you to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down that road. Statistically, people who lose a&nbsp;hand usually change their strategy. So&nbsp;it’s possible that your opponent will change to&nbsp;scissors or&nbsp;paper. That gives you another chance. Play scissors, and you’ll either win or&nbsp;draw.</p><p>Players who’ve been in&nbsp;the game long enough throw with their eyes closed. This way, they stay focused on&nbsp;their strategy and don’t let the actions of&nbsp;the other player affect their throws. If&nbsp;you win the first row, congrats ... and switch it&nbsp;up. Losers most often won’t stick with a&nbsp;losing throw and will play in&nbsp;a&nbsp;predictable order. But what if&nbsp;you lost? Then, go&nbsp;with whatever would have let you win in&nbsp;the previous throw. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you just lost with paper, go&nbsp;scissors next.</p><p>Your opponent will probably stick to&nbsp;a&nbsp;past winner and throw paper again. Winners like to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with what worked for them, hoping to&nbsp;repeat their success. If&nbsp;you lost the previous hand, it&nbsp;makes sense that your opponent will expect you to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;something else to&nbsp;win. And here comes another opportunity for you to&nbsp;trick them. Surprise them by&nbsp;sticking with your last choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bc5/07c/889cd25b81b69f141c9f2f48da.png><p>If&nbsp;they switch expecting you to&nbsp;switch, you have a&nbsp;really good chance of&nbsp;winning. If&nbsp;you went paper, and scissors cut you, don’t go&nbsp;scissors like they’d expect you&nbsp;to. Go&nbsp;paper again, and instead of&nbsp;blunting your scissors, the opponent will have to&nbsp;see their rock covered in&nbsp;paper.</p><p>But hey, rock paper scissors isn’t 100% based on&nbsp;Math or&nbsp;logic. These algorithms might not work, and you might lose. Plus, you can’t be&nbsp;sure your rival doesn’t know what you know. That’s why another successful strategy for rock paper scissors is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;random.</p><p>The most mathematically sound way to&nbsp;win is&nbsp;to&nbsp;play each option about one-third of&nbsp;the time but make sure your rival can’t predict your next move. It&nbsp;makes perfect sense as&nbsp;there are 3&nbsp;possible outcomes: a&nbsp;win, a&nbsp;loss, and a&nbsp;tie. There’s a&nbsp;strategy that can beat each of&nbsp;the strategies and another one that can beat&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;the best you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;your initial plan and use each move one-third of&nbsp;the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9c1/f74/c840635d0e8d37fa20e6000a95.png><p>Scientists who research the game concluded there are patterns that players follow, both on&nbsp;purpose and subconsciously. There is&nbsp;something known as&nbsp;the conditional response in&nbsp;game theory. Winners are positive the successful option will work for them again and stick to&nbsp;it, and losers change their strategy hoping for a&nbsp;better outcome. Game theory researchers from China’s Hangzhou invited 360 students for a&nbsp;mass experiment. Their task was to&nbsp;play 300 rounds of&nbsp;rock, paper, scissors in&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>After several hours of&nbsp;non-stop playing, the mathematicians managed to&nbsp;outline certain patterns in&nbsp;their tactical decisions and name the most successful game tactics. The counter tactic is&nbsp;the first strategy they pointed out. Here’s how it&nbsp;works: You played scissors. Your opponent played rock and blunted your scissors. So, what are you gonna&nbsp;do? Think one step forward and play paper. Just because your opponent will most likely go&nbsp;rock again to&nbsp;repeat their success.</p><p>Mirroring is&nbsp;the second game tactic that can let you win easily. So, you went scissors and cut some paper. Your opponent will think that you’ll go&nbsp;scissors again. Instead, surprise them and mirror their previous throw. This strategy puts together math and psychology. Enough theory for today. Back in&nbsp;your living room you change your mind, and instead of&nbsp;going rock as&nbsp;you planned&nbsp;to, you throw paper again. Your sister goes rock, and your paper covers&nbsp;it. It’s an&nbsp;unexpected turn for her. She insists you two should keep playing. You offer her to&nbsp;spice things up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>In&nbsp;Malaysia, for example, they throw bird instead of&nbsp;scissors. It’s made with the fingertips of&nbsp;five fingers together, looking like a&nbsp;beak. The open palm stands for water that replaces paper. Rock is&nbsp;the usual rock. Water beats stone because it&nbsp;sinks in&nbsp;water. Bird drinks the water and beats&nbsp;it. Stone hits the bird and beats&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5f3/c75/247d5d57eebcf88735eae10c5c.png><p>The Indonesian version has an&nbsp;elephant made of&nbsp;a&nbsp;slightly raised thumb, a&nbsp;human which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;outstretched index finger, and an&nbsp;ant, that’s an&nbsp;outstretched pinky finger. Elephant beats human, human takes over the ant, and the mighty elephant is&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;the ant. You both enjoy the game so&nbsp;much you decide to&nbsp;involve more people in&nbsp;it.</p><p>You invite 10&nbsp;friends to&nbsp;play the human rock, paper, scissors. You break into two groups and decide which pose is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;stand for each element. So&nbsp;you choose that everyone bends down and hugs their knees, rolling into a&nbsp;ball for rock. For scissors, everyone will stand with their legs shoulder-width apart and their arms up&nbsp;and hands behind the head. For paper, you’ll all stretch out on&nbsp;the floor.</p><p>All members of&nbsp;one group must strike the same pose for the first throw of&nbsp;the first round. Members of&nbsp;the second group strike their selected pose at&nbsp;the same time. It&nbsp;works pretty much the same way: rock blunts scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper beats rock.&nbsp;5&nbsp;rounds are a&nbsp;perfect number for a&nbsp;group this large. If&nbsp;the game gets boring, you can always make it&nbsp;themed. You can replace rock, paper, scissors with your favorite movie or&nbsp;book characters, schools, or&nbsp;sports teams. You’re all caught up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the game when suddenly you hear about a&nbsp;robot that has a&nbsp;100% winning rate at&nbsp;rock, paper, scissors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a4e/b67/c9e1ea5abba336f27199cfb6ac.png><p>Janken was named after the Japanese version of&nbsp;the game. It&nbsp;uses high-speed recognition and reaction.</p><p>It&nbsp;only takes Janken a&nbsp;thousandth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;second to&nbsp;recognize what the human is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;throw and choose the best move against&nbsp;it. You decide the robot can cheat, but you’ll only win fair with your new success strategies.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYyopaWxXWZ9cXnWoqWnoZ6cerTA0Zqrnp%2BpYrOwvoyrppyjXaWusbHRZqqcoaOovLO%2FjHFobW1kZXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./20-guys-who-cut-off-their-long-hair-and-now-they-look-like-super-stars-802583.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Guys Who Cut Off Their Long Hair, and Now They Look Like Super Stars">&larr;
