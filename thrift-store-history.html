For one thing, cities grew rapidly—partly because of the <a href=#>historical surge in new arrivals </a>during America’s biggest wave of immigration. The industrial revolution introduced the mass-production of clothing, changing the game. The more affordable it became to buy new clothes, the more people thought of clothes as disposable. Le Zotte points out that as urban populations grew, the size of living spaces shrunk, and more possessions were being thrown away. In addition to improved waste management systems, pawnshops and scrap materials sprung up during this period in an effort to find new uses for these items.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But there was a stigma attached to wearing used clothes that had been owned by a stranger. Not only were the items themselves a sign of a lack of money, but there was also bias against the people selling them. Used clothes were often available from pushcarts predominantly started by Jewish immigrants, whose professional options were often constrained by anti-Semitism. That prejudice rubbed off on their wares. For example, the May 3, 1884, issue of the Saturday Evening Post ran <a href=# rel=noopener>a satirical story</a> about a girl who got smallpox from a dress she bought from a Jewish-owned resale shop.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And yet it was clear that real money could be made in the thrift business. One group of people who saw the possibilities were Christian ministries looking for funding for their outreach programs. The religious affiliation of groups such as the Salvation Army and Goodwill offered a source of legitimacy, LeZotte argues.<a href=#> Americans started giving to charity more during this period, too</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Salvation Army’s “salvage brigade” launched in 1897 out of the basement of a men’s shelter. Residents went around the neighborhood with pushcarts asking for used clothes, and they got food and lodging in return. A Methodist minister launched Goodwill, a similar operation, in Boston in 1902, hiring poor and disabled people to collect the goods and do any necessary repairs. In turn, the offerings for sale in those groups’ shops gave immigrants a place to find clothes and become “Americanized.” Many thrift stores also offered social-service operations in addition to retail goods.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By the 1920s, thrift stores were as organized as department stores. Goodwill, for instance, had a fleet of trucks collecting clothing and housewares from more than 1,000 households. The terminology had changed too: Once considered “junk shops,” the word “thrift” reflected a marketing appeal that allowed middle-class housewives to “feel virtuous about buying something new because they can give something back,” Le Zotte says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By 1935, there were nearly 100 Goodwill stores nationwide, and thrift stores made up half of the Salvation Army’s annual budget by the time of the 1929 stock market crash.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the Great Depression, demand outstripped supply, as more people couldn’t afford to part with their belongings and buy new ones. The same thing happened during World War II. During the period of post-war prosperity, <a href=# rel=noopener>business boomed</a> at the Salvation Army and Goodwill thrift stores, as people increasingly donated their clothes so that they could redecorate their homes and refresh their wardrobes with <a href=#>newly-developed, better-quality synthetic fibers</a> and more colorful clothing. Consignment shops catering to a high-end clientele started to emerge in the 1950s, and wealthier consumers started coveting “vintage” clothes. The thrill of finding <a href=# rel=noopener>couture at a more affordable price</a> has never waned. Garage sales as a kind of charity fundraiser became popular during that period too, and the environmental movement later promoted them <a href=# rel=noopener>as a form of recycling</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the 21st century, shoppers don’t have to leave their home; they can browse and buy luxury consignment and secondhand wares online at websites like <a href=# rel=noopener>The RealReal</a> and <a href=#>thredUP</a>. An IBISWorld Industry report observed that in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, there was an uptick in companies opening for-profit thrift stores as cash-strapped people looked for more affordable fashion options. Macklemore’s song “Thrift Shop” topping the <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard Hot 100 </a>in 2013 was seen as a reflection of that increased foot-traffic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, thrift stores are part of a <a href=# rel=noopener>$14.4 billion industry</a>, according to an IBISWorld report on the state of the market. And as <a href=# rel=noopener>studies on consumer preferences</a> suggest millennials like to shop with companies that donate to charities, the thrift-shop model won’t fall out of fashion again any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2Zpfnh8jq2fq6GWqXq0wM6rnGagmajBsL7YaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./red-hot-riot-fela-kuti-world-aids-day-1235446827.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Red Hot Releases Expanded Riot: A Tribute to Fela Kuti Album for World AIDS Day">&larr;
