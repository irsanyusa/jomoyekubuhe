They are asking me for my opinion. I don’t know why I ever dreamed of playing for the Yankees. I want to be a shoe salesman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Specifically, I want to be Ben Evidente. The greatest shoe salesman in the world, Evidente, 33, is the anti–Willy Loman. He is a celebrity not only in Manhattan, where he has been selling for the Manolo Blahnik store for the past 12 years, but also around the world. When he stayed with clients in Brazil for Carnaval, he was bold-faced in the paper. Blahnik signed a copy of his book for Evidente, “To Ben. Without you, we are nothing.” He makes so much money that he just bought a vacation house in Hawaii. And here at the semiannual sale, with women standing in line down an entire block to get into the store, he is a ponytailed, tranquil cult leader amid a rush of manicured hands hopefully holding boots up into the curtained storeroom in supplication.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What I didn’t understand until meeting Evidente is how important shoes are. To me, shoes were just something that I casually noticed nicely set off the ensemble of a Victoria’s Secret model. But shoes, Evidente explains, can be hot in and of themselves. And the right shoe can make a woman look better. “You can almost spot a foot and not only know her size but what would look good: something to camouflage the bunion or something that accentuates a long, sexy leg,” Evidente says. One of his many skills is being able to talk about feet in ways that don’t seem creepy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s more, Evidente understands that shoes are freakishly important to women. His top clients buy 20 pairs of shoes a season, and he can make $20,000 in one sitting. “If they go bankrupt, I promise you they’ll be back in two seasons,” he says. “There is an actual obsession for women and their shoes. It took me two seasons to realize it.” Shoes, it turns out, look good on all women, regardless of body shape. “Women say, ‘My ankles and wrists are my best things,'” he explains. “They’ve gained a little weight. Women who may be overweight buy a lot of shoes because maybe they can’t wear Roberto Cavalli.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Evidente knows how to handle women. Although one regular client from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., here for the sale says he treats her “like a princess, even though I’m just one of the little people,” he also knows how to be rough. He bags a sale by the second pair of shoes he brings out, not just because he figures out what looks good on women but because he convinces them of it. In his quiet way, he is forceful, like Clint Eastwood. Plus he has the added appeal of often being down on one knee. “You almost have to make up their minds for them. They want you to make up their minds for them,” he says. He delivers lines like “This is a really important shoe this season,” with such a straight face, I do believe that this shoe is really important. He is so good at acquiring trust that many of his clients who don’t live in New York simply have him send whatever shoes he thinks might look good on them. And even when they do walk in, they cede power immediately. “Heidi Klum will come in here and say, ‘Ben, I have five minutes. Find me a pair of shoes,'” he says. I really want to be a shoe salesman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clients also ask for personal advice, because a good shoe salesman is a bartender and shoes are the rich woman’s whiskey. “You become their psychologist. You get to know who is getting a divorce and who is having an affair,” he says. Since many of them go to the same charity functions, he has to steer them away from the same shoes, especially when relationships become entangled. And like a bartender, he’s glad to push his wares on those in need. “When they say, ‘I just bought these to pick myself up,’ that feels good. That’s how it should be,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By my second day of hanging with Evidente at the sale–of staring at cross-laced calves, of seeing tight snakeskin squeeze against an ankle, of telling women that even though the heel may be a little high to walk in all night, yes, I think it’s worth it–I no longer see shoes. I see sex. This happens to me with most things I can’t eat, but still, I’m impressed that Ben has done this to me. I’m even more impressed that I have somehow handed him my American Express card and have bought my wife a pair of shoes that he insists really are on sale for $380. And are very important. And, as I discover when I get home, he is right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tb3FkaH5wss6oq6Wnn6iybrXNZp2aq5ievK97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./la-france-associative-en-2018-les-petites-associations-fragilisees.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="La France associative en 2019 : les petites associations fragilises">&larr;
