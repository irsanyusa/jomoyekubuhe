He was 88.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For over a half century, the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor, who received an honorary Oscar in 2017, memorably played villains, antiheroes, romantic leads and mentor figures. His profile increased in the past decade with his supporting role as the evil President Snow in “The Hunger Games” franchise.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Most recently, he appeared as Judge Parker on the series “Lawmen: Bass Reeves” and in the “Swimming With Sharks” series in 2022. His other recent recurring roles include the series “Undoing” and “Trust,” in which he played J. Paul Getty, and features “Ad Astra” and “The Burnt-Orange Heresy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland&nbsp;won a supporting actor Emmy for HBO’s “Citizen X” in 1995 and was also nominated in 2006 for the Lifetime miniseries “Human Trafficking.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After what Sutherland called “a meandering little career,” including roles in low-budget horror pics like 1963’s “Castle of the Living Dead” and 1965’s “Die! Die! My Darling!,” he landed a part as one of the bottom six in 1967’s “The Dirty Dozen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland told the Guardian in 2005 that he originally had one line in the film, until Clint Walker refused to play a scene requiring him to impersonate a general. According to Sutherland, director Robert Aldrich, who didn’t know his name, suddenly turned to him and said, “You! With the big ears! You do it!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The smart-alecky role was a perfect fit for Sutherland, whose wolfish sideways smile and boyish charm caught the attention of producer Ingo Preminger, who cast him as the anti-authoritarian surgeon Capt. “Hawkeye” Pierce in 1970’s comedy smash hit “MASH.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“MASH” turned Sutherland, and co-star Elliott Gould, who played Capt. “Trapper” John, into major stars. But the tradition-bound actors had trouble adjusting to director Robert Altman’s improvisational and often chaotic approach. According to Sutherland, Altman tried to fire him during the shoot, but Preminger held firm.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a 1976 Playboy interview, Altman gave a different view, recalling that Sutherland loved his directorial style. “His improvisation was profound,” Altman said. “He’s a hell of an actor.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland also co-starred with Gould in 1971’s inspired Alan Arkin-helmed black comedy “Little Murders” and again in director Irvin Kershner’s 1974 misfire “SPYS.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the 1970 WWII actioner “Kelly’s Heroes,” Sutherland joined Clint Eastwood, portraying Sgt. Oddball, an absurdly conceived but scene-stealing proto-hippie tank commander. (Sutherland reteamed with Eastwood in 2000’s “Space Cowboys,” this time playing a former hotshot pilot.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With 1971’s “Klute,” a thriller/character study directed by Alan J. Pakula and co-starring Jane Fonda, Sutherland emerged as a credible romantic leading man. He portrayed a troubled detective who falls in love with a call girl (Fonda) whom he’s protecting from a sadistic killer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fonda later gave Sutherland credit for her Oscar-winning best actress performance, because of “all the intense feelings I was experiencing” with him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The two were having a love affair at the time, and the relationship stoked Sutherland’s antiwar politics. He got involved with Vietnam Veterans Against the War and, along with Peter Boyle and Howard Hesseman, Fonda and Sutherland put together a traveling revue called FTA (Free the Army, popularly known as F*@k the Army). The Pentagon unsuccessfully tried to keep troops away from the shows; the FBI put both Sutherland and Fonda under surveillance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In Nicholas Roeg’s influential 1973 psychological horror film “Don’t Look Now,” Sutherland’s intriguing passivity and pared-down acting style helped highlight Julie Christie’s performance. They portray a grieving married couple who flee England to Venice after the death of their little girl.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The film became controversial for an integral explicit sex scene between them, edited in a fragmented style. Roeg intercut their post-coital dressing to go out to dinner as the sequence unfolds. Even in a sex-obsessed era, the scene became — and remains — one of the most memorable ever filmed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the height of his success, Sutherland began to make eccentric career choices. He turned down John Boorman for “Deliverance” and chose Paul Mazursky’s “Alex in Wonderland” (1970) over Peckinpah’s “Straw Dogs.” He acted with Fonda again in “Steelyard Blues” (1973) and played Christ in Dalton Trumbo’s “Johnny Got His Gun” (1971). Both fizzled at the box office.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland received mixed notices for his role as a hick in John Schlesinger’s “Day of the Locust” (1975), played the title character in 1976’s arty bomb “Fellini’s Casanova” and a psychopathic fascist in Bertolucci’s “1900” (1977). He had a memorable cameo in 1978 hit “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” playing a professor who is discovered having an affair with a student (Karen Allen). He took a small upfront fee for his work instead of an offered percentage of the profits. The actor estimated the choice cost him $14 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland rebounded with 1980’s “Ordinary People,” convincing director Robert Redford to cast him as the grieving father trying to hold his family together after his older son’s accidental death. Redford had originally offered him the part of the psychiatrist that eventually went to Judd Hirsch.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 1981 WWII thriller “Eye of the Needle,” Sutherland gave one of his last romantic leading man performances on the bigscreen, albeit as a heavy — a stranded German agent who falls for a lonely married woman (Kate Nelligan).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another career peak came in 1998, when Sutherland convinced director-writer Robert Towne to cast him as coach and Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman in “Without Limits,” about U. of Oregon runner Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup). He was also memorable in 2005’s “Pride and Prejudice” as Keira Knightley’s father.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland made a lasting impression in smaller roles, such as Mister X, a high-placed Pentagon official who claims to know why JFK was murdered, in 1991’s Oliver Stone-helmed “JFK.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Remarkably, Sutherland was never nominated for an Oscar, though his work in such films as “Ordinary People” and “Without Limits” is often cited by critics as among the finest of their respective decades.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Other noteworthy roles include President Snow in “The Hunger Games” (2012) and its sequels; a safecracker in “The Italian Job” (2003); the father in “Six Degrees of Separation” (1993); a stylish safecracker in “The Great Train Robbery” (1978); and the lead in Philip Kaufman’s 1978 remake of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland also appeared with son Kiefer in 1996’s “A Time to Kill.” He turned down an offer to play the father of Kiefer’s character, Jack Bauer, in “24,” his son’s successful TV series. The two appeared together in the 2014 Western “Forsaken.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 2014 the actor also starred with Brie Larson in the India-set musical comedy “Basmati Blues,” written and directed by Dan Baron.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland’s TV work includes “The Superlative Seven” episode of “The Avengers” (1967) and two episodes of “The Saint” (1965, 1966). He starred as Patrick “Tripp” Darling III in “Dirty Sexy Money” (2007-09) and as Nathan Templeton in “Commander in Chief” (2005-06). His TV miniseries work includes 2010’s “The Pillars of the Earth,” based on Ken Follett’s epic novel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In one of his best TV roles, Sutherland portrayed Clark Clifford in John Frankenheimer’s “Path to War” (2002). In 1995, he won a supporting actor Emmy for “Citizen X” (HBO).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Born in Saint John, Canada, he studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art before getting roles in British TV shows and films such as “The Avengers” and “The Saint.” “The Saint” star and director Roger Moore recommended him to the producers of “The Dirty Dozen,” and after the success of that film he moved to Hollywood.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A private celebration of life will be held by the family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sutherland is survived by his wife Francine Racette, sons Roeg, Rossif, Angus, and Kiefer, daughter Rachel, and four grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traJ6ZobpwusSwqmicn6OurbCMrKytoJWnuaK6w2abnpmUYrqiv8dmn66ml5q%2FbrPAppysZWFqfnqEjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thrift-store-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="History of Thrift Stores | TIME">&larr;
