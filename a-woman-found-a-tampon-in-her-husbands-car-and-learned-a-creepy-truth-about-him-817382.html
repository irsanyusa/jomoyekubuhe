After seven years and 2&nbsp;kids together, she had not a&nbsp;single reason to&nbsp;believe her 30-year-old husband would cheat on&nbsp;her. But what she discovered, later, made her wish he’d better cheated after all.</p><p><h2>The woman discovered a&nbsp;tampon that didn’t belong to&nbsp;her, inside her husband’s car.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aec/286/34726b5c11a04439417397acf9.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> took to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a> a&nbsp;story that held many people on&nbsp;a&nbsp;peak of&nbsp;<a href=# title=surprise data-link=tag>surprise</a>. She wrote that she’s been with her husband for seven years, married for four. She’s never had reason to&nbsp;suspect he&nbsp;was unfaithful to&nbsp;her or&nbsp;even remotely dissatisfied with their marriage. He&nbsp;even liked to&nbsp;joke that they were still living the “honeymoon phase” nearly five years and two kids&nbsp;in. The woman wouldn’t have questioned that, or&nbsp;him, were it&nbsp;not for a&nbsp;surprise she found in&nbsp;his car recently.</p><p>She wrote, “When buckling our daughter into her car seat, I&nbsp;noticed something slotted between the cushions. I&nbsp;pulled it&nbsp;out and saw that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;tampon. This wouldn’t have been so&nbsp;unusual had&nbsp;I not had an&nbsp;IUD that has stopped my&nbsp;period for the past year, and&nbsp;I didn’t even recognize the wrapper style.”</p><p>When she talked about it&nbsp;with her husband, he&nbsp;shrugged it&nbsp;off and supposed that it&nbsp;probably belonged to&nbsp;his co-worker, a&nbsp;married woman whose name was Fiona. Keeping in&nbsp;mind that he&nbsp;often carpools with his coworkers for lunch, the woman decided to&nbsp;drop it&nbsp;until weeks later when they were out to&nbsp;dinner with Fiona and her husband.</p><p><h2>The woman couldn’t let her doubts&nbsp;go.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/368/a53/89d4ea5da1ad9107e1e18be711.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, saying that she still had some doubts, which she wanted to&nbsp;put an&nbsp;end&nbsp;to. “I&nbsp;had sincerely wanted to&nbsp;believe my&nbsp;husband. I&nbsp;just couldn’t get over the way it&nbsp;had been tucked in&nbsp;the seat and how my&nbsp;husband had seemed not to&nbsp;have any regard for it&nbsp;whatsoever,” she explained. Her doubt brought her to&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;faking an&nbsp;“emergency” during dinner, after which she asked Fiona for a&nbsp;tampon&nbsp;— and she found the match.</p><p>Once again, she had put the issue to&nbsp;the side, until the very same thing happened again on&nbsp;the morning she decided to&nbsp;share her story on&nbsp;Reddit. “This time in&nbsp;my&nbsp;sock drawer. I&nbsp;feel physically ill at&nbsp;the thought of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband having an&nbsp;affair, and even more nauseated at&nbsp;the thought that the woman might have left these tampons out for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;find.”</p><p><h2>After finding the second tampon, there appeared one more worrisome evidence that something was wrong.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/900/3f2/fb69b25e8c82df1e189f82ea51.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “My&nbsp;sister was convinced it&nbsp;was Fiona&nbsp;— either having an&nbsp;affair with my&nbsp;husband, messing with&nbsp;me, or&nbsp;both.” Then she added, “My&nbsp;sister and&nbsp;I agreed that it&nbsp;was too soon for cameras without any other evidence, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;waiting game from there.”</p><p>She tried to&nbsp;look for at&nbsp;least some noticeable change in&nbsp;her husband’s behavior, but nothing happened. She was ready to&nbsp;call her investigation a&nbsp;“tampon fiasco” until her 2-year-old kid became ill. The illness itself wasn’t the problem, neither was her spouse’s decision to&nbsp;call off from work to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the baby; the problem was what the woman came home to&nbsp;by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the week.</p><p>The woman writes, “The toddler that I’d left that morning in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old&nbsp;PJ set was now dressed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;onesie I’d never seen before, with a&nbsp;tiny clip in&nbsp;her hair. I&nbsp;can’t say&nbsp;I have the sharpest memory, but&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;pretty good sense of&nbsp;what my&nbsp;kids wear on&nbsp;a&nbsp;day-to-day basis, and particularly what kinds of&nbsp;<a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> they wear.”</p><p>She immediately talked to&nbsp;her husband. She was sure that he&nbsp;never made purchasing decisions for their kids’ wardrobes, and it&nbsp;sure wasn’t something she would have ever dressed them&nbsp;in, but he&nbsp;again denied everything.</p><p>“With our daughter in&nbsp;the room and my&nbsp;emotions all over the place, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;leave&nbsp;it,” the woman wrote. “I&nbsp;couldn’t make sense of&nbsp;it&nbsp;then, and it&nbsp;hardly seems clearer now, after I’ve driven myself half-crazy with explanations that aren’t adding&nbsp;up.”</p><p><h2>The truth was discovered accidentally and left the woman in&nbsp;deep shock.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/329/802/6edf365b1cb55a4a503a3c9f62.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> an&nbsp;update to&nbsp;her story, and the <a href=# title=truth data-link=tag>truth</a> that she revealed just turned her life upside down in&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment.</p><p>She wrote, “A&nbsp;Ring notification had alerted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;motion at&nbsp;the front door while&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;work. Half-expecting to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;delivery person, pet, or&nbsp;lawn care salesman for the fifteenth time, you can imagine my&nbsp;surprise when&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;clip of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young woman leading my&nbsp;daughter into the house hand-in-hand, with my&nbsp;husband and other daughter close behind them. The girls were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;daycare and my&nbsp;husband at&nbsp;work. The woman, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew, was living two states away with a&nbsp;court order keeping her there.”</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out this woman was her husband’s sister. As&nbsp;our heroine soon realized, she was the likely source of&nbsp;both tampons, the onesie, and the bow. But the most disturbing thing of&nbsp;all was that this person had severe problems with law, and she was strongly prohibited to&nbsp;even approach the kids.</p><p>The woman wrote, “It&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;affair at&nbsp;all and still, somehow, infinitely more disgusting knowing who it&nbsp;was and <i>why</i> all of&nbsp;this had been happening. Apparently my&nbsp;SIL, fresh off another stint in&nbsp;rehab, had wanted to&nbsp;reconnect and make amends with people she’d hurt, and my&nbsp;husband was high on&nbsp;that list. My&nbsp;husband didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;or, worse, try and keep ‘her family’ (our children) away from her, so&nbsp;they’d been meeting in&nbsp;secret—often at&nbsp;our house when&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;work.</p><p>They would enter through the garage, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s car, so&nbsp;the Ring camera at&nbsp;the front door wouldn’t tip me&nbsp;off. She spent the night on&nbsp;a&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;I had been on&nbsp;a&nbsp;business trip and slept in&nbsp;our bed. She babysat our girls on&nbsp;a&nbsp;night my&nbsp;husband told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;had dropped them off at&nbsp;his parents’. She bought the girls clothes and dressed my&nbsp;youngest in&nbsp;the onesie and bow that my&nbsp;husband had promised on&nbsp;his life, I&nbsp;had dressed her in&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>Now, the woman is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;follow one of&nbsp;the commenters’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>advice</a>: “Call the cops and a&nbsp;lawyer.” And she will never ever be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;trust her husband again.</p><p>And here’s yet another story about a&nbsp;very creative woman who found <a href=#>a&nbsp;tampon</a> in&nbsp;her boyfriend’s room and instantly had a&nbsp;genius plan on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was cheating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uw86mmKdllqTCr7CMmmStmZ2lvK95yKdkoZ2iYrW2v8GapZ2rXZius3nAp5tmpJWWv6%2Bxw2aYZpuimrKxxYytqa6smGKuo7vUrWShoZ1ihXKDknFpaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ava-duvernay-origins-snubbed-overlooked-awards-1235835147.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Finding the Origin of the Oscar Problem: Why Isnt Ava DuVernays Best Film Winning ">&larr;
