She feels trapped, because of&nbsp;how her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her adoptive father is&nbsp;progressing. What she thought was an&nbsp;exclusively good bond between her and the husband of&nbsp;her mom, now turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship that she didn’t even expect and didn’t want at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started when the woman needed help from her family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49e/671/50237e5e97a7f029ab6c1161e4.jpg><p>The woman begins her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the Reddit communities, saying, «My&nbsp;(30f) step dad (58m) confessed to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with&nbsp;me. This happened 3&nbsp;years ago. For context, my&nbsp;mom and step dad got married about 10&nbsp;years ago. My&nbsp;mom and&nbsp;I are not close she walked out when&nbsp;I was 4&nbsp;and had me&nbsp;on&nbsp;weekends but&nbsp;I spent&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;my&nbsp;time with her parents and my&nbsp;aunt as&nbsp;she was to&nbsp;busy with whoever she was dating at&nbsp;the time.»</p><p>The woman’s relationship with her own dad wasn’t smooth since she was a&nbsp;kid. She said, " I&nbsp;was raised by&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad’s parents because my&nbsp;dad was too busy working all the time. I&nbsp;come from a&nbsp;very strict German family that are basically like Vulcans and show very little emotion.«</p><p>The woman appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very tough life situation and needed help. She revealed, «3&nbsp;years ago&nbsp;I suffered from a&nbsp;misfortunate relationship and&nbsp;I ended up&nbsp;moving in&nbsp;with my&nbsp;mom temporarily so&nbsp;she could help with my&nbsp;son while&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;treatment. This is&nbsp;when everything with my&nbsp;step dad started.»</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;very close bond between the woman and her step dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8c/d0a/75266c560e9e4d800018883630.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> that her stepfather was the first person to&nbsp;offer her some really good help and support.</p><p>She says, «After I&nbsp;got out of&nbsp;the hospital me&nbsp;and him got close. Everyday for 3&nbsp;months he&nbsp;would drive me&nbsp;to&nbsp;and from out patient therapy and we&nbsp;would just talk or&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;music. Harmless. When I&nbsp;had meltdowns he&nbsp;would talk me&nbsp;through it&nbsp;and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;shoulder to&nbsp;cry&nbsp;on. Harmless. We&nbsp;would go&nbsp;on&nbsp;hikes together with my&nbsp;son because my&nbsp;mom has health problems and would opt out. Again harmless. Or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought.»</p><p>She was treating her mom’s husband like her own father, but there was a&nbsp;red flag in&nbsp;their relationship.</p><p>The woman revealed," In&nbsp;my&nbsp;head, it&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I finally had a&nbsp;dad that showed me&nbsp;love and attention. I&nbsp;even gave him a&nbsp;card for Christmas asking if&nbsp;I could call him dad and he&nbsp;cried and said yes. I&nbsp;was overjoyed, I&nbsp;finally had a&nbsp;bond with a&nbsp;parent that I’ve never had before. Boy was I&nbsp;wrong. "</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all went too far and the woman feels uncomfortable now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/759/577/29e8cd5f9fa2535f56eb2fccfe.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, saying, that at&nbsp;one moment she clearly realized something was wrong between her and her stepfather.</p><p>She explained, «Now let’s bring in&nbsp;my&nbsp;now boyfriend Z(24m). He&nbsp;worked with my&nbsp;step dad and he&nbsp;brought him over one day and me&nbsp;and&nbsp;Z hit it&nbsp;off instantly. We&nbsp;hung out and talked for hours. My&nbsp;step dad started getting protective and&nbsp;I just read it&nbsp;as&nbsp;being a&nbsp;dad.»</p><p>Her step dad showed his true intentions and it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;shock for the OP.</p><p>She says, " Well one night we&nbsp;went out carp shooting like we&nbsp;normally did and that’s when my&nbsp;step dad confessed his love for&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;I felt the same way and said he&nbsp;wished he&nbsp;was 20&nbsp;years younger. He&nbsp;also admitted that his tears over my&nbsp;Christmas card were tears of&nbsp;sadness that&nbsp;I saw him only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dad. I&nbsp;awkwardly told him&nbsp;I just saw him as&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad and that night&nbsp;I cried myself to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;Z’s arms. Have I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;mom? No. She has a&nbsp;long history of&nbsp;choosing partners over&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;much that her ex&nbsp;gfs son SA’d me&nbsp;and she took his side over mine."</p><p><h2>Redditors were quick to&nbsp;deliver some pieces of&nbsp;good advice for the woman in&nbsp;the comments.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da7/efe/bc09db5d59a8a12b10586c4f3a.jpg><p>People of&nbsp;Reddit were quite supportive of&nbsp;the desperate woman and rushed to&nbsp;the comments section to&nbsp;share their views of&nbsp;the problem.</p><p>One user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «He&nbsp;gravitated towards a&nbsp;person in&nbsp;extreme vulnerability (you).</p><p>He&nbsp;knew you didn’t have any strong support systems, he&nbsp;grew closer to&nbsp;you while you were going through <a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a>.</p><p>If&nbsp;he&nbsp;<i>really</i> loved you he&nbsp;would know that you need a&nbsp;family or&nbsp;parental figure in&nbsp;your life more than anything. Telling you he&nbsp;wanted you romantically instead is&nbsp;selfish, cruel and also predatory.</p><p>I’m sorry you don’t have any long-standing support in&nbsp;your life, but stay strong (cringe I&nbsp;know) and make decisions you know are best for you. Cut these people out and make new family. You’re most important here.»</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «There’s a&nbsp;parallel mechanic in&nbsp;play here, which is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people „fall in&nbsp;love“ in&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely one-sided way, where they indulge in&nbsp;this idea about what a&nbsp;relationship with that other person could be&nbsp;like and get hugely emotionally invested <i>without any input from the other person.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;and of&nbsp;itself that’s not predatory, it’s merely dysfunctional. But then throw in&nbsp;a&nbsp;power dynamic where the subject has power over the vulnerable object of&nbsp;their affections, and throw in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attitude of&nbsp;entitlement towards reciprocation from the people you „love“, and it&nbsp;can become predatory really fast.»</p><p>And one more user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>, «This is&nbsp;wrong and gross. He’s your parental figure, he&nbsp;was doing what he&nbsp;should be&nbsp;doing.</p><p>Tell your mother what he&nbsp;said and then stop contacting or&nbsp;interacting with him in&nbsp;anyway.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story from a&nbsp;woman, whose <a href=#>MIL</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;obstacle for her relationship with her husband, even a&nbsp;romantic one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKtnKlllJaxbsDOpZtmpZVitaZ5yKxkoqZdoby3sYywoK2gXaKybrWMp6awZZaasq1506uYqaiVmXp5fZZyb2ln</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./patty-duke-obit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Oscar-Winning Actress Patty Duke Dies At Age 69">&larr;
