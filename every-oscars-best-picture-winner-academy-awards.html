They have also served as a time capsule reflecting what was going on in the world and/or in the entertainment industry each year. In the 21st century, Oscar has lost much of its TV audience, but the name recognition remains as strong as ever.</p><p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences handed out the first awards in 1929, with winners announced in advance. There were 12 categories, which has grown to the current 23. Hardcore film fans are interested in all of them, but the general public is most interested in three: best picture, actor and actress.</p><p>The first event, on May 16, 1929, was mostly a dinner for 270 people at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood; the ceremony itself lasted only 15 minutes. Most winners simply accepted the trophy, but Warner Bros. executive Darryl F. Zanuck did something radical: He gave a few words of thanks, thus inventing the acceptance speech. And the ceremony began to get longer.</p><p>Starting with the second event, in 1930, it was broadcast on radio, and then made its television debut in 1953.</p><p>The media often portrays campaigning as a newer invention, but after some actors saw the attention that the first winners received, they began to woo other Academy voters with dinners and parties.</p><p>Now, campaigns last roughly seven months, though planning starts even earlier. It’s become a mini-industry in terms of campaigners, consultants and event planners. While campaigns garner a lot of media attention, Oscars in the 21st century basically comes down to the same factors as the first ceremony: AMPAS voters see the nominees and vote with their conscience about what is best.</p><p>Of course, “best” is a subjective term.</p><p>Some of the early best picture winners seem creaky and dated (“Broadway Melody,” “Cavalcade”). Others, like “All Quiet on the Western Front,” hold up remarkably well.</p><p>In the 1940s, three BP winners were centered on World War II. In the 1950s, when many film workers felt threatened by television, they voted for big Technicolor spectacles that TV couldn’t offer, such as “The Greatest Show on Earth,” “Around the World in 80 Days” and “Gigi.” Most of these wouldn’t get made in the 21st century, much less win an Oscar. But voters are hard to predict: They also gave a best picture Oscar to “Marty,” a small-scale project that had originated on TV.</p><p>For most of the first seven decades, the best pic winner was also the year’s top-earning film. There were greats like “The Best Years of Our Lives,” “Lawrence of Arabia,” “The Godfather” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” — films that are still revered today. But in the 21st century, voters tended to favor small “arthouse” films that many home viewers hadn’t heard of.</p><p>Winning an Academy Award is the highest honor in the film world, and best picture is always the top prize. The fundamental things still apply as time goes by.</p><p>Click through for a look back at every Oscar best picture winner since 1927.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After winning a slew of precursor awards, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” swept the 2023 Oscars with seven trophies, becoming the most-awarded best picture winner since 2008’s “Slumdog Millionaire.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Everything Everywhere” took home Oscars for best picture, director, original screenplay, lead actress, supporting actress, supporting actor and editing. Michelle Yeoh became the first Asian best actress winner for her role as a laundromat owner dealing with family turmoil.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Though it built momentum throughout awards season, the A24 film’s win still felt surprising — not only had “Everything Everywhere” premiered a full year ago at SXSW, but with its multiverse storyline and surreal touches didn’t seem like the traditional Oscar-bait type of film. Its win seemed to prove that with hundreds of new voting members from all over the world, the Academy is finally embracing a diverse bunch of acting nominees as well as rewarding risk-taking directing choices.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>CODA</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Coda-Movie.jpg><p>The win for “CODA” broke multiple Oscar rules. It is the first best pic winner from a streaming service (Apple); it was considered an extreme longshot, with only three nominations (and no nom for the director, Sian Heder); and it didn’t land an editing bid, which many pundits consider a surefire clue to the eventual winner. “CODA” won all three of its nominations: picture, adapted screenplay (by Heder) and supporting actor (Troy Kotsur, who gave the evening’s most moving speech). The film’s Cinderella story began at Sundance in January 2021, where Apple paid $25 million for it. The win makes “CODA” the first streaming-service film to take Oscars’ top prize. When Apple debuted “CODA” in fall 2021, Variety said it was the year’s most radical film, since it centered on a deaf family, which Hollywood had never depicted. It became the second consecutive BP winner directed by a woman, after Chloé Zhao’s “Nomadland.” As more voters saw the film after its SAG ensemble win, they embraced its intelligence and open heart. After two years of COVID uncertainty, and worries about climate change, D.C. and Ukraine, it was cathartic to see a movie that made people laugh and cry.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nomadland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nomadland.jpg><p><strong>2020 Best Picture Winner</strong></p><p>In a year of COVID and minimal moviegoing, Oscar races seemed more unpredictable than ever. But Searchlight’s “Nomadland” was able to maintain its frontrunner status for six months, no easy feat. Voters responded to its warmth, the scenic beauty of the U.S. Southwest and its sympathetic look at displaced individuals who live in their vehicles. The film took two other prizes: Chloé Zhao became the second woman and the first Asian American woman to win for directing, while Frances McDormand (also a producer) won her third best actress trophy.</p><p>Read the Original 2020 <a href=#>Film Review</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Parasite</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/parasite-movie.jpg><p><strong>2019 Best Picture Winner</strong></p><p>The win for “Parasite,” from writer-director Bong Joon Ho, was historic: For 91 years, the top prize has gone to a film primarily in English. This South Korean comedy-drama was the big winner of 2019, also taking prizes for original screenplay, director and international film (the new name for the category formerly known as foreign-language film). When it won as international film, everyone presumed it would not be named best picture, but the reaction at the Dolby Theatre indicated that this was a surprising but popular choice.</p><p>Read the Original 2019 <a href=#>Film Review</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Green Book</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/viggo.jpg><p><strong>2018 Best Picture Winner</strong></p><p>The online haters were relentless; nobody seemed to like “Green Book” except audiences — and awards voters.

It’s an eccentric premise, but voters were swept away by the dreamlike visuals, the heart-on-your-sleeve emotions, and the subtle social commentary of the film.
